# HeatTransferVisualisation
This Python script calculates and visualizes steady-state temperature distribution in cylindrical and spherical geometries.

## Functionality

* Calculates temperature distribution for user-defined parameters:
    * Geometry type (cylinder or sphere)
    * Inner and outer temperatures (in Kelvin)
    * Inner radius and thickness (for cylinders) or radius (for spheres) (in mm)
* Generates a plot of temperature vs. radius.
